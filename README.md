Numerical methods in quantum mechanics
--------------------------------------

This repository holds the files which were used to do a computational analysis for the following:

One dimensional Schrodinger Equation
Schrodinger Equation for central potentials
Scattering from a potential
The Variational Method

Algorithms used:
----------------

Numerov Method
Bisection Method
Newton-Raphson Method
Secant Method

TODO:
-----

I'd be trying to improve the computational approach with the use of parallel algorithms.

References:
-----------
(I'd be adding more as and when I use)
